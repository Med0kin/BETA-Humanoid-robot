## Humanoid robot *BETA*

BETA is an ambitious undertaking that seeks to develop a humanoid robot possessing a range of human-like capabilities, including the ability to walk, see, and communicate verbally.

Conceived in 2018, the project has undergone several transformations and upgrades over the years. Presently, it is being developed as part of the "[Ko≈Ço Naukowe Humanoid](https://www.facebook.com/KNHStyleOfficial)" student scientific association, where updates on its progress and new features are regularly shared.

## Servo control

As previously stated, our project utilizes two distinct types of servos. Due to their differing control mechanisms, we have partitioned their descriptions into two distinct subcategories.

### Disclaimer

Our use of the term "pulse" refers to a conventional servo that employs a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal as its control input.

### Pulse Servo

Using mentioned library we've created tool to control servos with single commands.
To affix the servos to the robot's framework, we employ brackets that are included in the kit alongside the servos. The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins serve as the source of the PWM signal, which is generated by utilizing the software [pigpio library](https://pypi.org/project/pigpio/). We have developed a tool utilizing the aforementioned library, which allows for the control of the servos through the use of single commands.

</p>

During the process of developing the robot, it became apparent that the existing servos were not ideally suited to our requirements, as they were prone to excessive play and struggled to maintain a fixed position. As a result, we made the decision to incorporate [Bus servos](#bus-servo) in the leg joints, as these offer superior stability and control. By leveraging this approach, we can enhance the overall performance and reliability of the system, while enabling greater precision and accuracy in its movements.

### Bus Servo

In regards to the management of the second group of servos, communication is established through the utilization of the UART protocol, as the servos in question incorporate internal electronics. This approach enables efficient transmission of commands and data, as well as simplifying the wiring and control of the servos. By interfacing with the internal electronics of the servos, the system can achieve greater precision and flexibility in its movements.

### Sequencial movement

To achieve smooth movement we've created tool that allows to control servos in sequence. It's main purpose is to control servos in sequence to achieve smooth movement.

*INTERT DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEQUENTIAL MOVEMENT*

### Future plans

As part of our future development plans, we intend to upgrade the current servos with more powerful alternatives. This enhancement will enable the creation of more intricate and sophisticated movements. In addition, we plan to incorporate a more advanced control system, which will allow for the implementation of more complex behaviors and actions.

## Application

The software application that has been developed utilizes the PySide2 library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The primary objective of this application is to enable the user to manage and manipulate the behavior of a robot through a touch screen interface.

## Text-to-speech

For the purpose of text-to-speech, we have utilized the text to speech website. The website is accessed through the use of the Selenium library. The library allows for the automation of the browser, which enables the implementation of the text-to-speech functionality.

One possible solution to address this issue is to utilize an application programming interface (API) that provides text-to-speech functionality. However, after careful consideration, it was determined that this approach was not optimal due to cost implications and implementation complexity. As an alternative, a solution was chosen that is both cost-effective and easy to implement, and does not impose excessive demands on computer resources.
